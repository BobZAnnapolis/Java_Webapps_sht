	Tested on FireFox, IE and Safari - works on my machines
	
	ZeroFox homework assignment to get familiar with interfacing to
	3rd party APIs, processing their return structures, demonstrating
	my incompetence, etc....

	Given more time and/or more experience on where to find the 
	proper resources, I would separate this into more files, document 
	it better and handle things like mobile displays, localization, all
	the possible kinds of errors, exceptions etc., but since this was
	"only supposed to take 1-2 hours"... 

	...here's the process, along with my issues, with this assignment :
	After reading it, my initial feeling was shock, which was quickly followed
	by inadequacy cuz there's no way this should only take 1-2 hours.
	"Could a person with no exposure whatsoever to the Google Maps APIs really
	go from complete cluelessness to creating a 1 page HTML file with 
	some embedded JSP functionality that displays a map with multiple 
	informative pop up markers on it really be that easy ?"
	
	I assumed this wasn't a trick assignment so i started down the path of
	trying to figure this out. The 1st stop was Google and to perform a quick
	search along the lines of "How do I use the Google Maps API to display a
	map with some markers on it ?" That quickly got me started and had several
	links to some quick and dirty examples. And rather surprisingly, I was able 
	to quickly create an Eclipse Dynamic Web Application project, new HTML page and
	copy-paste one of those examples to use as a baseline. It actually worked,
	but was centered in Sydney, Australia. After looking at the data set and
	seeing that all of the states ['states' being the keyword here, stay tuned] 
	were in the U.S., I spent some time looking at the code to see what it was 
	doing. I saw it was using the hard-coded latitude/longitude coordinates in 
	the map options area. I didn't have latitude / longitude values, i had  
	string addresses. So i had to search some more to find a lat/long value for 
	the center of the US. The 1st few examples didn't help as they weren't
	in English or were using a version of Google maps that didn't match mine so 
	the fields on my screen weren't appearing on theirs. I eventually found one
	way to get the lat/long vals off a Google Map and used those values in this
	program. That change successfully changes the initial display but the zoom 
	value was off so I had to play with in order to arrive at a value I was 
	happy with.
	
	At this point, I had an initial display showing a map of the United States. 
	So far so good, but now about 45 minutes had passed :-(

	I now had to figure out how to display markers. Again to Google Search I went.
	The first few examples demonstrated how to do it if you already had a
	hard-coded array of lat / long values. No help there. I didn't have that so 
	the search went on. I searched for how to get lat / long values from addresses, 
	and that provided a plethora of examples to look at, which were implemented in 
	a wide variety of ways. 
	
	Having never done geocoding, i didn't know if what I was looking at was crap 
	so I copy-pasted different examples until I got one that appeared to work. 
	That example used a string array of 4 string addresses. The homework example 
	had considerably more so I copy-pasted the addresses from the homework example 
	into my HTML file, corrected them so that they became my data set and tried 
	running the program again......grrrrr.....
	
	....that's when i started running into this annoying "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT" issue. 
	No clue what the heck that was so had to search on that. I played around real 
	quick with the array size until I got it down to a size where the code could
	loop thru them all without getting the error pop up. I think it was around 8 
	or so.
	
	Once I had that functionality working, i saw that the other part of the homework
	was to implement the pop up address infowindow piece. So I searched some more
	until i found out how to do that and got that working. The 1st attempt had 
	every map marker displaying the same address so I had to correct that...
	
	....04:59:57...04:59:58...04:59:58...05:00:00...05:00:01...	
	
	At this point, 5 hours of my life was gone so I was feeling pretty bad
	about exceeding the expected time limit but i wanted to get it done. In 
	a sick masochistic way, I was enjoying learning this new stuff. I was 
	getting immediate visual feedback so I kept on. 
	
	At this point the program could display a map, some map markers and pop 
	up infowindows for each marker. But it couldn't handle the entire data
	set. So i needed to solve that problem. Back to Google Search and a 
	"How do i stop getting the OVER_QUERY_LIMIT error messages when I am trying 
	to get multiple lat / long values from the geocoder call ?" plea was 
	attempted. That opened up a can of worms. One of the 1st links led me back 
	to the GM API pages and instructions to get an API key. Well, the 
	instructions didn't match what I was seeing on my links but i managed to 
	figure out how to get a new key. I put it in my program :
               src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=(AIzaSyAXOw6ZGIv0SjIWft7SsF5L9U2hVFUyYAY)&sensor=false">	
               src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?v=3.exp?key=(AIzaSyAXOw6ZGIv0SjIWft7SsF5L9U2hVFUyYAY)&sensor=false">	
	No format worked. When i tried running, i couldn't even get the initial 
	US map to display. I was getting a pop up about Google disabling the use 
	of the Maps API because of an invalid key value.
	
	So back to searching other methods. One link said that the reason the
	OVER_QUERY_LIMIT happens is because the code is calling geocoder(address)
	in the initialize() function and you have to call it after the page
	loads. I wasn't doing it so that wasn't it. Another link said something 
	about having to perform off-line loading of the addresses into a lat / 
	long array and then just use this lat/long array in the marker loop code.
	I have a 1 page implementation restriction so I don't know what 
	"loading offline"  was talking about so i bagged that option. 
	
	Another option re-iterated the above "your hitting the server to 
	quickly" condition and said that you have to add a short timeout to the 
	individual queries for each lat / long value. That explanation showed 
	how to call the setTimeout function, but i couldn't find a valid example 
	of where it should go in the scheme of things so i put it in a few places. 
	Again coming back to this being just a single HTML file, there aren't 
	many places I could put it. I didn't place it in the initialize function 
	cuz the person who said "You have to wait until the document is fully 
	loaded and 'ready' to do something made sense. So with the initialize 
	function ruled out, my options were limited. I tried adding it to the 
	onclick method in the <body> section, in each of the other functions and 
	nothing worked. Still got the "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT" message.
	
	One odd thing about this approach was that it didn't seem to make a 
	difference where I placed the setTimeout call. No matter where i put it,
	the visual display seemed to loop thru all the addresses in the array 
	first and generate the OVER_QUERY_LIMIT message AND I only really ever 
	saw the setTimeout period get enforced when it went to display the markers.
	I would get the error popups real-time, then after the last popup occurred,
	the setTimeout delay would happen and  then I would see the amrkers. 
	So that is either an inherent thing that everybody who has spent time doing 
	web development work knows how to bypass and which is lost to me or 
	there's something else going on which i haven't figure out yet. I spent a 
	good 2-4 hours just looking for solutions to this issue and trying different 
	combinations. This added even more time spent on this than what was 
	initially estimated.
	
	So now, besides being a little frustrated, I got to thinking....maybe, just
	maybe this was a trick question. Maybe I was too quick to try to find a solution 
	to a problem without doing some appropriate initial due diligence. So i 
	decided to take a different angle. I created another HTML/JSP program that 
	simply demonstrated the ability to loop thru the entire string array of 
	addresses that were provided for the assignment. I got that up & running 
	and started reading the page.....Tiger, Missouri......8498 Noble 
	Autoroute, Jansen, Maine....King Salmon, Rhode Island......Bjorkdale, 
	Alaska.....Love Lady, Rhode Island...hmmm, and i feel kind of stupid cuz it 
	really wasn't until i got to...Scary, Kentucky....that I said "Wait a 
	second, are these even real places ?!?!?!?!"
	
	So, one by one, i started evaluating the data set. I did Google searches on 
	each and every "city, state" combination and when all was said and done, 
	only one was valid city,state : McLean, Virgina. So I went to McLean, VA 
	on the web and searched for "Silent Cider Alley". I couldn't find it. There
	is no such place. After spending 2 days to get to this point, i decided to 
	make an executive decision and created the enclosed solution, i.e., it only 
	uses a data set containing the only valid city, state address i could find.
	
	This solution is what is presented below. I could have made this submission 
	even shorter by using the original example I found which just displayed 
	hard-coded vals for Sydney, Australia and changed them for McLean, VA. 
	
	When i thought about it, if i had done that, then i would have gotten this 
	done in the 1-2 hour timeframe that was estimated.....part of me is hoping 
	that you folks will get back to me saying that was one possible solution 
	to this exercise.
	
	It was kind of fun, in a way, getting it to this point but it definitely 
	brought up some issues that I don't see how they could have been detected 
	and addressed [by someone who has never done geocoding] in the allotted 
	timeframe. 
	[1] I had a version that was looping thru all the original string addresses, 
		and it was displaying an "Alert(address+status)" message. The status 
		field was coming back with "OK", "ZERO_RESULTS" and "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT" 
		vals. There "could" be some additional code added to filter out the 
		"ZERO_RESULTS" queries......but.......
	[2] ....to piggy back on the above, if I can figure out how to prevent 
		the "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT" message from occurring, i could have tried to 
		pre-process the original data set and build a 'working' data set that 
		only included the lat / long values for those queries which came back 
		with an "OK" status.....however....
	[3] ...the caveat to this approach is that in reality, if you tried to 
		look up every single string address from the original data set, 
		you won't find any of those places to be real. So now I am completely 
		stumped as to why any of the geocoder(address) calls were coming back 
		with "OK" status messages, none of them should have. I should have 
		gotten "ZERO_RESULTS" for every one, why isn't that happening ?
		
	To investigate that, would require even more time. So for the sake of
	getting this submitted to you folks for review, moving the process
	along and me getting to other assignment, I decided to submit this.
	
	So that is the process I went thru to arrive at this solution. I learned 
	a lot, and if i didn't do too much wrong, i now know have some serious 
	doubts about trusting the validity of an "OK" status response from Google's
	geocoder(address) call. I also now know why some people end up in the wrong
	place when asking Google Maps for driving instructions.....
	
	For my own benefit, I'm still gonna work on this to figure out how to 
	get the "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT" issue solved, and to handle the different 
	status messages.
