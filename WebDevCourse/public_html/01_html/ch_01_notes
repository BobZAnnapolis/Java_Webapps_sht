- Getting Help
    jsbin.com
        - free site, post html, css, javascript files - so others can help debug

- Intro to HTML
	- create a simple file called hello world.html, no tags, find in Finder - display in browser

- Composition of a web page
	go to google.com
	right-click - select View As Page Source
	example.com - view page source
		composed of open-close tags
		1st line - usually doctype tag
		2nd line - usually <html> - beginning
	1st section
		<head>
			information @ page
			link to other files we need to download, styles, javascript to help display
		<title> - 
		<meta> - info @ page
			charsets - important to set, utf-8
			content type
				html, charsets
			viewport
				important for mobile devices
		<style>
			usually css - cascading style sheets
				- how to display the page
	main section
		<body>
			<div>
				- division of web page, different content
			<h1>
				headers
			<p>
				general text content
			<a href=>
				anchor, i.e., a link to a uri

- Header tags
	h1 - usually only 1 - largest
	h2 - h6 - descend in size
	h6 really small - rarely used
	h7 and greater unnecessary - text is same size as current paragraph-sized font

- Paragraph tags
	<p> - creates line breaks on page but with lots of padding
	<br/> - makes lines closer together
	<hr/> - cane used as a separator, draws a line in an html page

- Formatting text
	unordered lists
		use a <ul> tag to start the bulleted unordered list
			use <li> tags within for each list item
	ordered lists
		creates a list with numbers
		use a <ol> tag to start the ordered list
			use <li> tags within for each list item
	images
		use img src=“” tag
			src can be local [provide path] or remote [go to pic site, copy img url
			can use additional parts to size it, eg,height, width
- Forms
	not much use w/o server side code to process the form
	but can still do client stuff to learn how to lay one out
	user input fields
		input=text
			small text input, free format
			use name= field to send in GET request, can see it in URL when ban pressed
		input=email
			browser will validate
		select-option
			implements combobox single-select
		input type=radio
			implements single-select via radio buttons
			need to use same ‘name=‘ field to group
		buttons
			input type=submit
			use value= to change ban text
	adding “name=“ field to each tag sends screen content to server to be evaluated
		need to name/format incorrectly based upon type= field

- Links
	make links to : <a href=“..location info here…”>
		other sites on the web, 
		images local and on the web,
		other ‘anchored’ on the same page 
			- need web pages w/lots of scrollable real estate
			- use <a name=“here”> to id place to jump to
			- jump to it using <a href=“#here”>

- Tables
	use <table> tag
	tables composed of :
		headers - use <th>
		rows
		columns
			- determined by ‘cells’ - use <td> tag - ‘table descriptor’
	need to use styles and css to make tables ‘prettier’

- HTML Entities
	use these to get ‘special characters’ to display on a web page
	eg, ‘<a>’, or special language chars like accent marks, copyrights, etc
	w3schools.com - good resource
	start with an & and end with a ;
		lots of different kinds - see resource for examples
	can use character codes on the web page

	EXAMPLE : TO GET MULTIPLE SPACES use &nbsp !!
		BETTER TO USE styles to accomplish this but in a pinch - this will work

- iFrames
	used to embed content form another page in your webpage
	embeds html pages inside a box
	also used to embed things like YouTube videos
		- go to YouTube
			- under the video, choose the Share-Embed option
				= that will give you the iFrame to put into your web page
	the course video said this wouldn’t work but it worked just fine for me in iMac using FireFox

- Putting altogether
	combines all the above into 1 html page
	new things :
		to get the video to align correctly - use align tag
		to get the form submit button to go to a web page - use action tag
			<form action=“http:..url..”> used with
			<input type=“submit”
		button click will send user to action location - used like a link
