Chapter 02 - CSS
================

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
	set of instructions to tell a browser how a web page should look

HTML - content
CSS - style

Can be found embedded in web pages or referenced in a separate folder

“style” section contains groupings of the different components that are
	to be displayed on the web page along with descriptors for things
	like font size, background/foreground colors, padding

the web page components can just reference these defined-once ’styles’
	instead of re-defining/copying all the descriptive information
	to each place on the page

Inline CSS 
	- adds css style attributes inline w/html tags
	bad idea - difficult to maintain when changes needed; not very adaptable;
	really complicated to read when both in the same place

Internal CSS 
	- have a separate ‘style’ section in the HTML page that defines
	all the styles for the html tags being used; define once - use many;

Classes and IDS
	used to make 1 paragraph one style and another paragraph a different style
	uses a .class_nm format in style area and then called out in html tag
		eg <p class=“large”>
	classes usually used multiple times
	ids usually only used once on a page
		ids defined in style section beginning w/#
	can combine class & id
	use <span> to only affect the words between the <span> tags
		can combine multiple classes and ids inside tags
DIVs
	just a “division” of your web page
		headers, footers, etc
	way to separate content on a web page into logical sections
	just by using the tag doesn’t do much visually
	the “fun” comes in when you assign styles to it
	can use many different attributes to control the look
	divs are always rectangles, can specify :
		colors, width - see reference for more
	when text is inside a div - the size attributes can determine 
		formatting of the text, eg, word-wrap
	if you want all the divs to look the same - just redefine one
	if you want them to look different - use classes

for all of these things - there is a default “style” for every HTML
use this technique to ‘override’ the default version

Colors
	html-color-codes.info - great web site for colors
	gives you HTML codes to get a wider range of colors

“FLOATING” DIVS
	up to now - every control been appearing underneath one another
	can use float: 
		direction attributes in the style get objects to
		move around the page, eg,left, right
	using just this will usually get page messy and cause overlap
		can use a ‘clear’ style to get things back to reading better

	as you resize the page 

POSITIONING
	to move things “a little” around the page, use the “relative” style 
		attribute
	this relative style takes additional positioning attributes that
		are used to move it “relative” from the normal place it
		occupied on the page
	a lot of times you are using pixels - be careful - you could easily
		move the section over others on the page
	objects are placed on the page in the order they are defined in the page
	you can change this by giving elements ‘z-index’ values
		larger values have higher priority
	ONLY objects using “position:relative” AND “z-index:#” will obey
		positioning/overlapping rules
	can move things off the page by specifying top,left attributes with 
		negative values
	position:static - default setting
	position:relative - moves things around ‘relative’ to where they would
		otherwise be
	position:absolute - occupies a certain location on the page BUT all the
		other objects ignore it being there, eg, if the 1st thing on
		a page has this, the rest of the objects will start being placed
		at the same location - there will be some blocking/overlap
	position:fixed - kind of the same as absolute EXCEPT the object of fixed
		at a certain position on the browser page so that if you scroll
		it will NOT scroll of the page
		- useful to keep a header bar always visible as you scroll

MARGINS
	margin:#px - establish a ‘margin’ around the entire DIV
		multiple values assigned in clockwise order starting at top
		or use margin-left, -right, -top, -bottom

CSS_PADDING
	very similar to margins
	margins mostly used to put space around DIVS
	padding used to put spacing on text, objects inside the div
	<p> tag itself has some default padding,margins so keep in mind
	can “override” by writing your own <p> tag

NOTE:  by adding MARGINS & PADDING, you’re also increasing the width & height

	can do the same as above with padding-left,-right,-top,-bottom vans


BORDERS
	‘border’ style attribute
	need to specify width {in px} color type {eg, solid”
		eg, border:5px red solid;
NOTE: 	adds to width & height as well
	see : http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.asp
	can also change borders on each side - new tags
		border-style
		border-width
		border-color
		specify all 4 sides, starting on top
	border-radius:10px - rounded look
	border-radius:50px - circle when height/width = 100px;

FONTS
	lots of choices associated with fonts
	see http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp#font
		http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp
	font-family selected has backups listed in case machine
		page being rendered doesn’t have the specific one
		defined in css - there will always be a default

STYLING TEXT
	font-weight:bold
	font-style : italic
	color: green
	font-size : set percentages or pixels {px} or ‘em’
		1 em = 16px {16px is default font size}
	add all these and more inside a class to create endless combinations

ALIGNING TEXT
	text-align: left, center, right and justified
	when using align - aligns according to the parent tag it is within
	justified : stretches text out to fit within a div or p

tags within another tag inherit the properties of the tags it is within

STYLING LINKS
	target=_blank - opens linking a new tab
	a:visited - to change visited color
	a:hover - change what link does when you hover the mouse over it
