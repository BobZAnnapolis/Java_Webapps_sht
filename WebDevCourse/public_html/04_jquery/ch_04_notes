Chapter 04 - jQuery
===================

	framework
	javascript library that sits on top of javascript
	allows you to access certain functions more easily

	jquery.com
	jqueryui.com
		lots of UI feature sets
	lots of easy plugins to do all sorts of visual affects
		typeahead
		image sliders
		image displayers

TO USE :
	to use jquery - you have to download the version you wish to use
		and then point to it inside your html file in the <script> 
		tag  <script src=“path to query.js”></script>
	use compressed version - it’s smaller - use uncompressed if you
		want to look at the code
	“usually” websites have a “js” folder where all  the javascript 
		files live, can save it in there if you want

	you can also link to the libraries by referencing their locations
		at google, etc - a little slower but if speed isn’t a
		priority….
		eg., src=“http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js”

	advantages of local 
		- you know the exact version {above versions will change}
			- again, if you want that, do it hat way
		- can also modify it when it is local
		- YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET

	advantages of website
		- will always reference the latest
		- changes are very HIGH that the user has already
			visited a webpage that has referenced this location
			and the browser will already have downloaded it


	has a built-in (jQuery) variable - do a simple test to see if it exists
		and display an alert


	Inside the <script> tags, detecting a click would be something like
		$(“id/class_field_name”).click(function() {
			….insert click code here
		}
		$ - a built-in jQuery indicator/selector

	$(“id/class_field_name”).hover(function() <- do something when
		‘hovering’ over an item

	can also select all of a certain section, eg all the “divs”
		$(“div”).click
	ANY ELEMENT TYPE can be used !!

	$(“field_nm”).html() <- select html of a field
	$(“field_nm”).html(“new text”) <- change html
	var str = $(“field_nm”).html  <- save the contents of a field
	
Changing Styles
===============
	use the .css function

	in the script - you can perform an action on ALL of the elements by using
		the generic name, eg “div” or “p” - but when in the function - to 
		do an action on the actual one clicked - you can use ‘this’

	$(“”).css(“style_nm”) - accessing a style
	$(“”).css(“style_nm”, “new_value”) - accessing a style

	$(this).css(“display”,”none”); <- make it hidden, or,
	$(this).hide();

	$(this).fadeOut - visually fades from view - sets display to “none”
	$(this).fadeIn - visually fades into view
		- have lots 

	the “fade” functions above are simple - they do have additional 
		functionality -look it up

Fading Content
==============
	http://api.jquery.com/fadeout/ - lots of examples


CALLBACK FUNCTIONS
==================
	called when another function ‘completes’ its action
	usually embedded inside another function call, eg,
	$(this).fadeOut(2000) - a 2 second fadeout, to call a fcn when the fadeout is done….
	$(this).fadeOut(2000, function() {
		function code goes here
	    } // end of callback function
	) // end of fadeout call


ANIMATING CONTENT
=================
	jQuery does this VERY well
	once an elements is selected, call the .animate() fan
	lots of parameters, look them up, eg at http://api.jquery.com/animate/
		eg, $(this).animate({width:”300px”},1500) <- change the width to 300px in a second and a half
	example usage
		have small text - click on to enlarge tomato it easier to read

AJAX
====
	Very powerful Javascript technology, jQuery does it very well
	Aynschronous Javascript and XML
	Asynchronous - does it in the background while javascript executing the foreground
	essentially does stuff in the background while your user is interacting w/web page

NOTE : AJAX and javascript WON’T work using the ‘file’ protocol in your browser, i.e., can’t
	load a local file containing AJAX to test it out - MUST be done on a ‘real’ site

USING : http://176.32.230.47/bobz.com/04_jquery/examples/08ajax.html


	An example of how to use ajax to get content from a web site
	eg $.ajax({
			url:"08ajax.html"
		}).done(function(data) {		
			alert(data);
		});


Regular expressions
===================
It is a way to track for a particular string being a particular pattern
check for: email addresses, urls

jQuery has a built-in str.matchfcn
format - put string between /, eg, regex=/great/

if it finds it, returns the string itself, otherwise returns null

it is case-sensitive; add an intend to be case-insensitive
